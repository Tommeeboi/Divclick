# Divclick
A website game using no Javascript Libraries or images! (apart from the links at the top of the page)

Created in 5 months (including a 2 month break) by Tommeeboi (Me). I'm a one man army.

## How To Run
It's very easy, don't worry.

WARNING: This only works for PC/Mac users. Mobile devices can't run this properly (Androids can't, dunno about everything else.)

Divclick is still in Alpha, so expect lots of bugs and unfinished features.

## Releases
The Alpha versions were private and were only shown to people I know.

Alpha v1: First Alpha

Alpha v2: Fixed visual bugs and added license

Alpha v3: The target square no longer randomly disappears (including all dimension settings.) Dimensions other than 10x10 are still buggy though

Alpha v4: The game is now more accurate, and the correct square is no longer one square to the left of the coloured one

Alpha v5: All dimensions now work properly, and the game resets properly (including new popups)! WOO

Beta v0.0 (22/09/2022): First Beta! Introduces the ability to change the speed of the target, as well as bugfixes and improvements

Beta v0.1 (23/09/2022): "Click submit first" is now a proper popup. Also fixed the link to the Status, and added comments to game.js.
